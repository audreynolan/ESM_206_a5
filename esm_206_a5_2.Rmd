                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)

```{r}

# read in data
mack_raw <- read_csv("mack_creek_vertebrates.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(-pitnumber, -length2, -notes)
```

Part A: 
```{r}
# notes from part A: 
# Pacific Giant Salamanders, Dicamptodon tenebrosus.(DITE)
# need to find total annual DTE counts

# wrangling data to get counts for OG and CC

counts_dite <- mack_raw %>% 
  filter(species == "DITE") %>% 
  group_by(year, species, section) %>%
  summarize(counts = sum(entity))
```

- Make graph showing counts

---

Part B: 
```{r}
# I = riffle, IP = Isolated pools, 
dite_2017 <- mack_raw %>%
  filter(year == "2017",
         species == "DITE", 
         unittype!="IP") %>% 
  group_by(unittype, section) %>%
  summarize(counts = sum(entity)) %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = round(((counts/sum(counts))*100), digits = 2))
```

- Make table

---

Part C:

- **Using Part B df w/ 2017 DITE**
- Do test where two samples ARE independent of each other (same place, different cut)
- Similar test to what was done with coffee and departments (in Lab 8)
- Report in text (in context of actual counts)

---

Part D:
```{r}
weight_section <- mack_raw %>% 
  filter(year == "2017",
         species == "DITE") %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(median_weight = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_weight = round(mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2),
            sdev = round(sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2),
            count = sum(entity))
```

---

Part E
```{r}
weight_channel <- mack_raw %>% 
  filter(year == "2017",
         species == "DITE") %>% 
  group_by(unittype)
```
